# Overview
I just spent a few weeks learning about Python and wanted to take it a step further by incorporating a database. In my learning, I found that SQLite3 is natively supported in Python, so I wanted to explore the possibilities there. 

This program is a database of questions with answers, added, modified, and deleted by the teacher as needed, that will be displayed to students.

This program, like most things I write as I'm learning, is meant to enhance my homeschool. It will run a "Boss Battle" (which is just a gamified quiz to help the kids get excited about reviews), displaying questions, then answers (after the student provides their answer).



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}
